    </li>
</ul>
<p>As they journey through the mysterious forests of <span class ="accent ">${localityKindom.forests}</span>, the ruined city of <span class ="accent ">${localityKindom.city}</span>, and the sea-drenched world of <span class ="accent ">${localityKindom.sea}</span>, they uncover ancient secrets and face off against various foes.</p>
